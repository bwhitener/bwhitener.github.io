<h2>Fun facts about cats:</h2>
<br>
<br>
Cats have powerful night vision, allowing them to see at light levels six times lower than what a human needs in order to see.
<br>
<br>
Cats make about 100 different sounds. Dogs make only about 10
<br>
<br>
Cats hate the water because their fur does not insulate well when it’s wet. The Turkish Van, however, is one cat that likes swimming. Bred in central Asia, its coat has a unique texture that makes it water resistant
<br>
<br>
The normal body temperature of a cat is between 100.5 ° and 102.5 °F. A cat is sick if its temperature goes below 100 ° or above 103 °F
<br>
<br>
Cats are extremely sensitive to vibrations. Cats are said to detect earthquake tremors 10 or 15 minutes before humans can.
<br>
<br>
One reason that kittens sleep so much is because a growth hormone is released only during sleep.
<br>
<br>
A cat almost never meows at another cat, mostly just humans. Cats typically will spit, purr, and hiss at other cats.

<br>

Usually one or the other decides to leave the scene, sometimes quickly, sometimes after a short standoff.
